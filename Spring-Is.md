### Spring Is
By Amarie

Spring is green grass growing,  
New leaves on trees,  
Flowers blooming,  
People planting gardens,  
The sun shining brightly in the sky,  
Animals coming into the world,  
Warm winds blowing,  
Birds coming back.  
no more brown,   
Joyful colors returning.  
Spring is a time   
of laughter and cheer,  
And everyone loves it  
When springtime is here!
